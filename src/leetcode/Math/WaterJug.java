 * 
 * Bézout's identity (also called Bézout's lemma) is a theorem in the elementary theory of numbers:
 * let a and b be nonzero integers and let d be their greatest common divisor. 
 * Then there exist integers x and y such that ax+by=d
 * 
 * In addition, the greatest common divisor d is the smallest positive integer that can be written as ax + by
 * every integer of the form ax + by is a multiple of the greatest common divisor d.
